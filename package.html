Introduction
</H2>
<HR>
The Call Center Package extends the Core API by  supporting
the following key Call Center features: 

<A HREF="#Routing"> Routing </A>, 
<A HREF="#ACD"> Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) </A>, 
<A HREF="#PredCalling"> Predictive Calling </A>, 
<A HREF="#AppData"> Application Data </A>.</P>


<H2><A NAME="Routing">Routing</A></H2>
<HR>

<P>Routing is a call center feature that gives applications the
ability to route calls to their final destinations. It gives 
applications the power to apply routing heuristics unique to their domains.</P>

<P>Before performing any routing functions, an application must first
 register with the switching domain to route calls for
a specific Address. The switching domain may perform security checks to
verify that the application has permission to route calls for that Address.
An application can indicate that it wants to route calls for all Addresses
within the Provider's domain by invoking registration methods on a RouteAddress
created with a special valid Address &quot;AllRouteAddress&quot;. The RouteAddress call center
interface extends the core Address interface with methods for routing
registration. </P>

<P>When a call is made to an Address, the switching domain sends an event
(or request) to the application, which then should respond with a 
destination Address
or with a &quot;no destination&quot;. Application can choose
among alternate destinations based on, for
example, origin of the call (calling number), number dialed to place
the call (called number), hour of day or availability of agents to handle
the call. This is the basic request/response scenario for routing. </P>

<P>If the switching domain gets a response from the application, tries the Address 
returned and fails, it could ask the application for another destination. The 
application must know that this is not a new route request, but a request for a new
destination from a previous request. Multiple calls may be placed to the
same Address at the same time.  Thus, applications must track each request/response
session. This tracking is facilitated by a route session. The first route
request for a new call to the Address starts a new route session. All further
communication between the application and the switching domain for this call (re-routes,
route ended, etc) is done within this session. A new RouteSession object
represents an outstanding route request. </P>

<P>The RouteCallback interface provides an interface to handle routing
events. An application implements the RouteCallback interface so that 
the application
will be
"called back" when its provider wants the application to route a call.
The getRouteableAddresss method on CallCenterProvider returns the
list of Addresss that an application on this provider can register to route
calls for.</P>

<p>
The RouteSession object is at the heart of all routing.  Below is a state
diagram that illustrates the transitions possible on RouteSession.

ROUTE: The RouteSession object enters the ROUTE state when the provider
requests the application to route a call
</p>

<P>

ROUTE_USED: The RouteSession object enters the ROUTE_USED state when the
provider gives the application the destination for a successfully completed
route request.
</P>

<p>

ROUTE_END: The RouteSession object enters the ROUTE_END state when the 
provider informs the application that a route session has ended or when 
the application ends a route session.
</p>

<p>

RE_ROUTE: The RouteSession object enters the REROUTE state when
the provider requests the application to choose another call route.
</p>

<P>

ROUTE_CALLBACK_ENDED: The RouteSession object enters the ROUTE_CALLBACK_ENDED
state when the provider informs the application of the termination of a
previously registered route callback.

ACD Address
</H3>

<P>Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) is a Call Center feature that defines
an ACD Group as zero or more Agent extensions that service calls coming to
the Group. An incoming call can, for example, either sent to an available Agent or queued
when no Agents are available. </P>

<P>
The primary interface for the ACD feature is the ACD Address, an extension of CallCenterAddress. 
This is a specialization of Address that distributes calls to a dynamic set of Terminals. 
ACD Address is not directly associated with a Terminal because it is a logical entity within 
the Provider and as such does not have any physical attributes. 

<HR>
<p>
<CENTER>
<h3>ACD Address Model</h3>
</CENTER>

<center><img src="doc-files/ACDAddr.gif"
		ALT="ACD Address Model"></center>
<HR>
<P>
  Calls that are presented to an ACD Address may be processed in
several different ways. For example, the call may be queued at the ACD
Address before being distributed, the call may be delivered to one of
the available Agent Terminals, or the call may be redirected to
another ACD Address. The Connection interface which represents the
relationship between the ACD Address and the Call is known as ACD
Connection.

</P>
<p>
  The dynamic association between the ACD Address and a given Terminal
is represent by the Agent class. The Agent object represents an
AgentTerminal's relationship to an
 ACDAddress. You can think of the Agent object as representing a person acting as an agent in
 the simplest case where the person is logged into only one ACD
Address.
 If the person were logged into several ACD Addresses these scenarios
 would be represented as several Agent objects.
 This Agent has a set of state transitions to represent its
association. For example, when a Terminal creates an association with
a given ACD Address (i.e.Agent Logged In), or when the Terminal is
associated with a given ACD Address and is ready to process a call
from the ACD Address (i.e. Agent Ready). For more details, on the
states, see the Agent State Diagram below. A Terminal that can be
associated with ACD Addresses is represented by the AgentTerminal
which is an extension of the Terminal interface. </P>

</CENTER>

<P><IMG SRC="doc-files/Agnstat.gif" HEIGHT=400 WIDTH=540
   ALT="Agent Terminal States"></P>

<P>

UNKNOWN: The AgentTerminal object enters the UNKNOWN state when the provider
is unable to determine the state of the AgentTerminal.
</P>

<P>

LOG_IN: The AgentTerminal object enters the LOG_IN state when the AgentTerminal
is logged into an ACDAddress.
</P>

<p>

LOG_OUT: The AgentTerminal object enters the LOG_OUT state when the 
AgentTerminal has logged out of an ACDAddress.
</P>

<P>

NOT_READY: The AgentTerminal object enters the NOT_READY state when it is
busy with tasks other than servicing calls.
</p>

<P>

READY: The AgentTerminal object enters the READY state when it is
ready to service calls.
</p>
<P>

WORK_NOT_READY: The AgentTerminal object enters the WORK_NOT_READY state when 
it is disconnected from a call and is busy with tasks associated with
a call.
</p>
<P>

WORK_READY: The AgentTerminal object enters the WORK_READY state when 
it is ready to resume the tasks associated with a call.
</p>

<p>

BUSY: The AgentTerminal object enters the BUSY state when is is engaged in
a call and cannot handle other ACD calls.

<H3> ACD Manager </H3>

<P>
Some Provider implementations have a more complex ACD feature in
which a group of ACD Address can be managed logically as one
Address. In order to support this function, the Call Center model has
included another Address interface to handle this ACD Address group
management. This interface is known as an ACDManagerAddress. It is an
extension of an Address. Calls that are presented to an ACD Manager
Address may be processed in several different ways. For example, the
call may be queued at several different ACD Addresses before being
distributed to an Agent Terminal, the call may be delivered
immediately to one of the available Terminals associated with a given
ACD Address in the group, or the call may be redirected to another ACD
Manager Address or individual ACD Address.The Connection interface
which represents the relationship between the ACD Manager Address and
the Call is known as ACDManagerConnection.

<H2><A NAME="PredCalling">Predictive Call</A></H2>
<HR>

<P>Predictive Call is a key cornerstone of Call Center feature. An application
uses it when it wants to launch a call where the destination is connected
to the call first and the originator is connected only after the connection
to the destination is successful.</P>

<P>A typical application is one where an application wants to contact a
list of potential customers, about for example a newspaper subscription
promotion. The application has a list of telephone numbers that correspond
to the customers. The application picks one number at a time from this
list and makes a predictive call. If no one answers, the call is dropped.
If a customer answers, an attempt is made to connect the originating device.
The originating device may be an ACD group, in which case an ACD agent
anwers for the originating device. After this call is established the application
moves on to the next telephone number on the list and repeats its actions.</P>


<H2><A NAME="AppData">Application Data</A></H2>
<HR>

<P>Application Data allows application to associate application specific
data with a call. Methods on the CallCenterCall interface support setting
and getting application data. In addition an event, ApplicationDataEvent,
is sent when the set method is used or the provider associates data with
the call from another source.</P>
