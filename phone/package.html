Introduction
</H2>

<P>
This document provides an overview of the <EM>Phone Extension Package</EM> to
the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP> Telephony API.
The Phone Extension Package permits implementations
to describe physical Terminals in terms of standardized components.
Applications may query each Terminal, using this package, for the components
of which it is made and control certain attributes of these components.

<STRONG>Note:</STRONG>
<EM>
The Phone Extension Package was previously named the <STRONG>Set Extension
Package</STRONG> in Version 1.0 of this specification. Because of overwelming
feedback on this specification, the Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-2>TM</FONT></SUP>
Telephony Specification working
partners decided the term <STRONG>Set</STRONG> was ambiguous and has many
meanings. Additionally, backwards compatability to the name <STRONG>Set</STRONG>
will <STRONG>NOT</STRONG> be maintained. We apologize for any inconvienience this
may have caused.
</EM>

</P>

<P>
The Phone Extension Package defines a number of components standard to
traditional telephone-set hardware. These components include speakerphone,
microphone, display, buttons, ringer, handset, and
lamp. Each component exports a standard interface to control its attributes.
For example, the ringer permits applications to control its volume, while
the buttons permit applications to simulate pressing buttons.

<A NAME="ARCHITECTURE">Phone Package Architecture.</A>
</H2>

<P>
This section explains how the Phone package describes Terminals in terms of
their individual components.
</P>

<H3>
Component Interface
</H3>

<P>
The Phone package consists of a set of interfaces, each
modelling some physical feature of a traditional telephone hardware set. There
exists interfaces to model buttons, displays, lamps, ringers, hookswitches,
speakers, and microphones. Each of these distinct interfaces provide methods
to control the attributes inherent to each component type.
</P>
<P>
Each individual component extends the <STRONG>Component</STRONG> interface. These
corresponding individual component interfaces are: <STRONG>PhoneButton</STRONG>,
<STRONG>PhoneDisplay</STRONG>, <STRONG>PhoneLamp</STRONG>, <STRONG>PhoneRinger</STRONG>,
<STRONG>PhoneHookswitch</STRONG>, <STRONG>PhoneSpeaker</STRONG>, and
<STRONG>PhoneMicrophone</STRONG>. Each component is identified by its type and
a string name.
</P>
<H3>
ComponentGroup Interface
</H3>

<P>
One or more individual components are organized into component groups. These
component groups represent an association between components as they exist
on the actual, physical hardware. Applications obtain an array of the
components associated with a component group via the <EM>getComponents()</EM>
method on this interface.
</P>

<P>
There may be more than one ComponentGroup associated with a single Terminal
object. Applications obtain an array of the component groups associated with
a Terminal via the <EM>getComponentGroups()</EM> method on the
<STRONG>PhoneTerminal</STRONG> interface.
</P>

<P>
Terminals may have more than one ComponentGroup for the following reasons: at
times an implementation may want to model a physical endpoint (i.e. Terminal)
with two groups of components. One of these groups may model a telephone
hardware set sitting on a person's desktop, while the other group may model
a "virtual" telephone set drawn on the person's workstation's display.
</P>

<P>
Only a single ComponentGroup may be "activated" on a Terminal at a time. The
act of activating a ComponentGroup enables its components to become actively
part of the telephone call. For example, if a speaker component is part of
a ComponentGroup which is activated, that speaker will receive all of the
media sent to it. Applications activated a ComponentGroup with the
<EM>activate()</EM> method and deactivate a group with the <EM>deactivate()</EM>
method.
</P>

<BR><BR>

<H2>
<A NAME="TERMINAL">Extending the Terminal Interface</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Phone Extension Package extends the core Terminal interface with the
<STRONG>PhoneTerminal</STRONG> interface. This interface permits
applications to query for the components which make up the Terminal object.
</P>

<P>
As described in the previous section, each Terminal is composed of zero or
more <EM>ComponentGroups</EM>. These groups are obtained via the
<STRONG>PhoneTerminal.getComponentGroups()</STRONG> method. The following code
segment queries for the Terminal named "5551212" and for the groups of
components associated with this Terminal.
</P>

<PRE>
try {
  Terminal terminal = myprovider.getTerminal("5551212");

  ComponentGroup groups[];
  if (terminal instanceof PhoneTerminal) {
    groups = ((PhoneTerminal)terminal).getComponentGroups();
  }
} catch (Exception excp) {
  // Handle exceptions
}
</PRE>

<P>
Once an application obtains a list of groups, it may choose to activate one
of these groups. The meaning of activating and deactivating a group of
components was described in the previous section. The following code segment
chooses the first group and activates it.
</P>

<PRE>
if (groups != null &amp;&amp; groups.length &gt;= 1) {
  try {
    groups[0].activate();
  } catch (Exception excp) {
    // Handle exceptions
  }
}
</PRE>

<P>
Next, applications may query for the array of individual components in the
component group. An application may iterate through this array and control the
attributes of each component-type. In the code sample below, the application
looks for the microphone component and sets it on the maximum volume.
</P>

<PRE>
Component components[] = groups[0].getComponents();

 for (int i = 0; i &lt components.length; i++) {
  if (components[i] instanceof PhoneMicrophone) {
    PhoneMicrophone mic = (PhoneMicrophone)components[i];

    mic.setVolume(PhoneMicrophone.FULL);
  }
}
</PRE>

<A NAME="COMPONENTS">Phone Package Standard Components</A>
</H2>

<P>
The Phone Extension Package defines a number of standard components found on
traditional telephone hardware. Each component exports its own interfaces and
controls over its attributes. Each component also has specific events 
indicating when its attributes change. This section briefly describes each
component, the methods available on its interfaces, and the event associated
with them.
</P>

<H3>
Button Component
</H3>

<OL>
<P>
The <STRONG>PhoneButton</STRONG> component models a button on a telephone keypad.
Applications may "press" this button via the <EM>buttonPress()</EM> on the
PhoneButton interface. Each button has an indentifying piece of information
associated with it (e.g. the text label on the telephone keypad button).
Applications may obtain and set this information via the <EM>getinfo()</EM>
and <EM>setInfo()</EM> methods, repsectively. Additionally, there may be
a lamp-component associated with a button, obtained via the
<EM>getAssociatedPhoneLamp()</EM> method.
</P>
<P>
Applications receive the <EM>ButtonPressEv</EM> event when the button component
has been pressed and the <EM>ButtonInfoEv</EM> when the identifying
information on the button has changed.
</P>
</OL>


<H3>
Display Component
</H3>

<OL>
<P>
The <STRONG>PhoneDisplay</STRONG> component models the display on the
telephone hardware set. This display is composed of a certain number of
rows and columns. Applications may set and obtain the text displayed at
a particular coordinate via the <EM>setDisplay()</EM> and <EM>getDisplay()</EM>
methods, respectively.
</P>
<P>
When any information on the display has changed, the application receives the
<EM>DisplayUpdateEv</EM>.
</P>
</OL>


<H3>
Hookswitch Component
</H3>

<OL>
<P>
The <STRONG>PhoneHookswitch</STRONG> component models the physical hookswitch on
a telephone hardware set. (A <EM>hookswitch</EM> is the level component on the
telephone set on which the handset rests, which is depressed when the phone
is on-hook.) The Hookswitch component can either be in an ON_HOOK state or an
OFF_HOOK state. The application may set and obtain the hookswitch state via
the <EM>setHookswitchState()</EM>) and <EM>getHookswitchState()</EM> methods,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Applications receive the <EM>HookswitchStateEv</EM> event when the state of
a hookswitch changes.
</P>
</OL>

<H3>
Lamp Component
</H3>

<OL>
<P>
The <STRONG>PhoneLamp</STRONG> component models a light-indicator on the telephone
hardware set. Often, this lamp is a single green-color or red-color LED. Lamp
components have a "mode" attribute which indicate the pattern of its flashing
light. For example, the lamp mode can be LAMPMODE_FLUTTER, LAMPMODE_STEADY,
or LAMPMODE_WINK, to name a few. Applications may set and obtain the lamp
mode via the <EM>setMode()</EM> and <EM>getMode()</EM> methods, respectively.
Additionally, lamp components may be associated with a button component. This
button component is obtained via the <EM>getAssociatedPhoneButton()</EM> method.
</P>
<P>
Applications receive the <EM>LampModeEv</EM> when the mode of the lamp component
has changed.
</P>
</OL>


<H3>
Microphone Component
</H3>

<OL>
<P>
The <STRONG>PhoneMicrophone</STRONG> component represents the audio input device
on a telephone hardware set. The microphone has a single attribute: its gain.
Applications may set or obtain the microphone's gain via the <EM>setGain()</EM>
and <EM>getGain()</EM> methods, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Applications receive the <EM>MicrophoneGainEv</EM> event when the gain of a
microphone component has changed.
</P>
</OL>


<H3>
Ringer Component
</H3>

<OL>
<P>
The <STRONG>PhoneRinger</STRONG> component represents the audible ringing device
on a telephone hardware set. The ringer component has several attributes.
First, applications may control the ringing pattern of the ringer component.
In order to control the ringing pattern, applications obtain the number of
ringing patterns via the <EM>getNumberOfRingPatterns()</EM> method. Applications
then set the ringing pattern via the <EM>setRingerPattern()</EM>. It uses an
integer index value between zero and the number of ringing patterns minus
one. Applications may obtain the current ringing pattern via the
<EM>getRingingPattern()</EM> method, and the number of rings which have already
happened via the <EM>getNumberOfRings()</EM> method.
</P>
<P>
The ringer component also has a volume attribute that may be set or obtained
via the <EM>setRingerVolume()</EM> and <EM>getRingerVolume()</EM> methods,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Applications receive the <EM>RingerPatternEv</EM> when the ringing pattern has
changed on the ringer component and the <EM>RingerVolumeEv</EM> when the ringer
volume has changed.
</P>
</OL>


<H3>
Speaker Component
</H3>

<OL>
<P>
The <STRONG>PhoneSpeaker</STRONG> component represents the audio output device
on a telephone hardware set. The speaker has a single attribute: its volume.
Applications may set or obtain the speaker's volume via the <EM>setVolume()</EM>
and <EM>getVolume()</EM> methods, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Applications receive the <EM>SpeakerVolumeEv</EM> event when the volume of a
speaker component has changed.
</P>
</OL>
