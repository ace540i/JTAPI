/* Incoming Telephone Call Example:

   This example application demonstrates using JTAPI to 
   answer calls to a particular Terminal.
   It shows how to add a Recorder onto a call when it is answered.
   
   A Desktop application to allow an agent to answer a call 
   and record the conversation could use this logic.
   The recording resource could be on a PBX, 
   on an adjunct IVR connected to the PBX, 
   or on a desktop PC, depending on how the MediaProvider is implemented.
   
   This code is the same as the core InCall code example, with the addition
   of the recordCall() method which is invoked after answer.
